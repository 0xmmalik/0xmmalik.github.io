##### So I added the most overpowered item to my Minecraft mod.

Angel Crystals are the latest addition to my [Minecraft mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-crystal) and they're super strong. The overall premise behind these Crystals is that using them can give you special powers or effects. For example, the Aqua Crystal lets you mine faster, gives you underwater night vision, and Dolphin's Grace. Similarly, the Angel Crystal gives you some extremely overpowered effects that make you nearly invincible! I got the inspiration for them because I had used chains of command blocks to give myself these effects in the past in my own survival worlds so I could gain a significant edge over any mobs that came my way (and so I'd never have to eat; something which I found largely annoying).

The Angel Crystal, when coupled with the Dark Sword or Axe makes you nearly unstoppable. In fact, once you use the Angel Crystal, even a direct hit from a supercharged creeper when you're not wearing any armor won't kill you. A Ravager does 1.5 hearts to you without any armor. At this point, wearing armor at all seems like cheating!

Is this too overpowered? Possibly, but it is still possible to die. Though unlikely, if enough things happen to you at once, even the effects of the Angel Crystal won't be enough to save you.
