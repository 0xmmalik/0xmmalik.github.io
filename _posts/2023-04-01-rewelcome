##### So I guess I'm back.

Having recently done some updates to my portfolio website, I've realized it's probably a good idea to talk about stuff to the one person (myself) who regularly reads these. As decisions for college grow imminent, I hope I'm not April-fooling myself into thinking I can write here somewhat regularly!

Ideas for future posts: MHSCTF reports, upcoming competitions, college updates
