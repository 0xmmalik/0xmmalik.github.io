blurb: My experience running a CTF

##### So I organized and hosted a CTF two years in a row... on my own!

I independently organized and hosted [MHSCTF 2022](https://mhsctf2022.0xmmalik.repl.co) and [MHSCTF 2023](https://mhsctf.0xmmalik.repl.co) and I've finally decided to record some of my thoughts on the experience for other people or (more likely) future reference for myself.

### What is a CTF?
CTF stands for capture-the-flag.
