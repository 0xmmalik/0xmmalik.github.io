        <h4>A capture-the-flag cybersecurity competition.</h4>
        <p>After founding Mentor High's Computer Science club, I decided to reach out to some people to collaborate and host our school's first-ever cybersecurity competition: MHSCTF. The event was a massive success! In 2022, we reached 1600+ participants in 800+ teams from 20+ countries all over the world! The 2023 competition had 2300+ participants from even more countries. You can find MHSCTF online <a href="https://mhsctf.0xmmalik.repl.co" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h4>My research paper on reverse engineering.</h4>
        <p>As the field of cybersecurity grows ever larger, so does its influence in education. Specifically, recent years have seen a major increase in popularity of capture-the-flag competitions, of which reversing engineering (frequently of string manipulation programs) makes up a major part. These challenges involve determining the necessary inputs for a program to produce a desired output. Reverse engineering Python source code is a non-trivial task so performing it manually frequently becomes infeasible.</p>
        <p>This paper presents Cornucopia, a partially automated reverse engineering tool that operates over Python source code to determine necessary inputs to arrive at outputs. Cornucopia takes advantage of symbolic representation to partially automate the process of reverse engineering programs that are affine or include conditional branching. A basic evaluation of Corncuopia finds that it significantly reduces human interaction in reversing, and is composable.</p>
